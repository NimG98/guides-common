Nothing more needs to be done for Docker Desktop.

[system]#*{linux}*#

Perform the following two steps to return your environment to a clean state.

Firstly, point the Docker daemon back to your local machine:

```
eval $(minikube docker-env -u)
```

Then, stop your Minikube cluster:

```
minikube stop
```

Finally, delete your cluster:

```
minikube delete
```
